# CS361-FinalProject
This is the final project for my software design 1 course. It is a simple Node Express CRUD app that simulates a traffic incident reporting system.

Just like in my final databases project, I apologize in advance for putting everything in index.js and for not having the db connection details in my gitignore.
This project was done fairly early in my career and I've learned better since then.

Also, the db host is no longer active, so none of the db interactions will work; nor will you be able to break into the database with the connection info.

This is an incomplete project, so I hesitate to leave it in my repos, but I know some of my team mates still use it so I'm leaving it up for now.
